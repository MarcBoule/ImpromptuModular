If this plugin ceases to be compatible with the current version of VCV Rack, and no contact can be established with the plugin's author within a reasonable time-frame (a few weeks or so), then this policy statement allows the owner(s) of VCV Rack to designate a new developer who can fork the project and maintain its inclusion in the VCV Library.
